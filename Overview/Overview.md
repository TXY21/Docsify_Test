# Overview

DECADA runs on Envision OS (EnOS) 
DECADA is a Multi-Tenant Cloud Platform which forms the Device Management Layer of Smart Nation Sensor Platform. DECADA (Device Management, Control and Data Acquisition Systems) offers an easy and powerful solution for agencies to implement and manage their Internet Of Things (IoT) networks.
 
Understanding DECADA
The IoT Tech Stack is a set of tools and services for sensors and IoT applications and is also known as DECADA. It consists of three core components, which facilitate the acquisition and exchange of data from sensors to the cloud. Agencies can use DECADA to easily develop and run IoT applications.
The three core components of the IoT Tech Stack are as shown below.
DECADA Edge Gateway: A product and software solution to onboard new and existing sensor nodes to DECADA easily and securely. It is both a gateway to DECADA Cloud, and an edge device to process and aggregate sensor nodes data to reduce data traffic to the cloud. Agencies can make use of its web user interface to allow for various combinations of sensor nodes connection and data processing.

DECADA Embedded (formerly known as MANUCA): This is a family of microcontroller-class devices that can communicate directly to DECADA Cloud. DECADA Embedded provides software reference designs for onboarding and communication with DECADA Cloud. Hence, developers can add custom application logic for their use cases and quickly have a ready-to-deploy embedded device.

DECADA Cloud: A multi-tenant cloud platform deployed on the Government Commercial Cloud. DECADA Cloudâ€™s features include asset management, data acquisition, event triggers, stream processing, data analytics, report generation and APIs for querying data.
